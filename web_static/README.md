# AirBnB Clone - Web Static

## Overview

This project focuses on the initial steps of developing the front end for the AirBnB Clone. The primary objectives include creating simple HTML static pages, establishing a style guide, populating pages with fake contents, and avoiding the use of JavaScript or external data. This README documents my approach and contributions to the project.

## Project Progress

1. **HTML Structure:** I began by crafting the HTML structure for various elements of the AirBnB application. Each static page's structure is designed to be clear, logical, and in accordance with best practices.

2. **Style Guide:** I contributed to developing a comprehensive style guide outlining design principles, color schemes, typography, and other visual elements. The goal is to maintain consistency throughout the application.

3. **Fake Contents:** I populated the static pages with placeholder or fake contents. This step aims to provide a visual representation of the design and layout, helping to visualize the final product.

4. **No JavaScript:** Throughout this phase, I adhered to the project's requirement of avoiding the use of JavaScript. The focus was solely on creating a static prototype.

5. **No External Data:** I ensured that no data is loaded from external sources at this stage. The emphasis is on creating a standalone static representation.

## Repository Structure

The project repository follows a structured organization:

- **/web_static:** This directory contains static assets (HTML and CSS files) for the AirBnB web application.
  - **/styles:** CSS files are stored here.
  - **/images:** This directory houses any static images used in the project.

## Style Guide

The style guide, available in the /web_static/styles directory, serves as a reference for design principles, color codes, typography, and other visual elements. I followed this guide to ensure a consistent and visually appealing design.

## Conclusion

This project marks a significant step in the development of the AirBnB Clone. The static representation provides a foundation for building a fully functional and visually cohesive web application in the upcoming phases. I look forward to continuing the collaborative efforts in the next stages of the project.
